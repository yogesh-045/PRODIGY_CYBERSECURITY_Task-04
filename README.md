Simple Keylogger
Task-04: Safe Input Logger (Ethical Demonstration)

This project demonstrates a safe and ethical input logging tool that records only the text typed inside the program itself.
It does NOT record system-wide keystrokes and does NOT run in the background, making it fully legal and safe for academic and internship purposes.

🔐 Why a Safe Logger Instead of a Keylogger?

Real keyloggers can capture:

Passwords

Private chats

Banking details

Such programs are harmful and illegal without explicit consent.
This project avoids all unethical behavior and implements a controlled input logger only for learning.

🧩 Features

Logs text entered inside the program

Saves logs with timestamps

No system-wide keyboard monitoring

No background execution

Ethical & safe demonstration

Simple, beginner-friendly Python script

📂 Project Structure
input_logger.py  → Main program
log.txt          → Stored logs generated after running
README.md        → Documentation

▶️ How to Run

Make sure Python is installed.

Run the script:

python input_logger.py


Then type any text.
To stop logging, type:

exit


All logs will be saved in:

log.txt

✔ Internship Declaration

This project is created for PRODIGY InfoTech Cyber Security Internship – Task 04 as a safe alternative to harmful keyloggers.

It complies with ethical guidelines and does not capture system-wide keystrokes.
